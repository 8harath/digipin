## üèõÔ∏è About DIGIPIN

The Department of Posts has undertaken an initiative to establish a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for a standardized, geo-coded addressing system in India. As a part of this initiative, the Department is releasing the final version of DIGIPIN ‚Äì the foundation layer of the DPI.

DIGIPIN is an open-source national-level addressing grid developed by the Department of Posts in collaboration with IIT Hyderabad and NRSC, ISRO. It serves as a key component of the digital address ecosystem.

After extensive public consultation and expert review, the DIGIPIN Grid has been finalized to provide simplified addressing solutions for seamless delivery of public and private services and enable ‚ÄúAddress as a Service‚Äù (AaaS) across the country.

Key highlights of DIGIPIN:

- A uniform offline/online address referencing framework for logical, precise location identification
- Enables GIS integration, bridging the gap between physical and digital addresses
- Supports digitalization of service delivery across sectors such as emergency response, e-commerce, logistics, BFSI (Banking, Financial Services & Insurance), and governance
- Aligns with the National Geospatial Policy 2022, enriching India‚Äôs geospatial knowledge stack

DIGIPIN simplifies address management and enhances service delivery accuracy, promoting a thriving geospatial ecosystem for India's digital economy.
